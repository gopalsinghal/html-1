<p>
    <sup>1</sup>Darren started using Sinatra in 2009 after falling in love with the direct simplicity it offers. At the start of 2010 he started the I Did It My Way blog, detailing his quest to master Sinatra, and at the end of that year used Sinatra to build the Cards in the Cloud website. Darren also writes Sinatra tutorials for RubySource.
