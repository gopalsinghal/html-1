        <p>The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is the most numerous tiger subspecies in Asia, and was estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals by 2011. Since 2008, it is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by poaching, loss and fragmentation of habitat. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large enough to support an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals.</p>
        <p>The tiger arrived in the Indian subcontinent about 12,000 years ago. India's tiger population was estimated at 1,706–1,909 individuals in 2010. By 2014, the population had reputedly increased to an estimated 2,226 individuals. Around 440 tigers are estimated in Bangladesh, 163–253 tigers in Nepal and 103 tigers in Bhutan.</p>
        <p>The Bengal tiger ranks among the biggest wild cats alive today. It is therefore considered to belong to the world's charismatic megafauna. It is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh.</p>
